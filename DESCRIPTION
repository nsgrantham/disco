Description: Nine discrete color palettes for qualitative, diverging, and sequential 
             data developed by Paul Tol <https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/>. Colors 
             within each palette are designed to match well together and be readable 
             by all audiences, including color-blind readers. Use disco() to 
             retrieve a palette's colors in hex codes or use scale_colour_disco() 
             and scale_fill_disco() with ggplot2.
